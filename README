# DiamondMVC
## a web developer's scaffolding or the Linux of web server platforms.

The objective of *the Diamond* is to accelerate the development process of any kind of web
project. Unlike a CMS, it does not provide you with a WYSIWYG editor to quickly write
new content for your website, instead it features merely a carefully laid out MVC,
internationalization (i18n), plugin and extension systems.

All while allowing you to code practically anywhere in your own preferred coding style!
